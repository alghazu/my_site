  description:
    Conduct a study and analysis of the IEEE 802.11ac current state of the standardization.
    Develop a MATLAB® simulation for generating and receiving 802.11ac physical layer frames.
    Run simulations on the hardware platform (SMU & CMW) in order to analyse and define requirements
    (e.g. spectral flat rates, EVM, dynamics, data rates).
    Estimate resources and the resulting requirements for hardware and signal processing algorithms.
